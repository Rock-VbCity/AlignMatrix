The align-matrix component is implemented with the Text & Image chart visualization; We were unable to find supporting documentation in the Qlik's Help pages, Google's search were futile as well.<br><br>

<b>Motivation:</b><br>
I am currently developing an extension where this component will be very helpful, but I found something surprising when studying its behaviour, because its returned values seems to be out of whack! You may notice that by looking at the table below.
